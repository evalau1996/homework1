<h1>The Visualization of Air Quality</h1>
<p>How many indexes do you know related to air quality?</p>
<p>And how much do you know about them?</p>
<ol>
  <li>Air Quality Index(AQI)</li>
  <li>Air Quality Health Index(AQHI)</li>
  <li>Hedley Environmental Index</li>
</ol>
<h2>Air Quality Index(AQI)</h2>
<p>AQI makes full use of people’s reaction towards colours.</p> 
<ul>
    <li>Green represents safety and pureness.</li>
    <li>Red symbolizes danger and warns people.</li>
    <li>The darker the color is, the more serious the air quality will be.</li>
    <li>Yellow and Orange are just between them .</li>
</ul>

<h3>Air Quality Health Index(AQHI)</h3>
<p>AQHI is the Hong Kong version of AQI, released in 2013.</p> 
<p>Just like AQI, different colours conveys different signals.</p>

<p>However, the drawbacks of AQI and AQHI are similar.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Does green represent absolute safety？</li> 
    <li>Can all the danger levels be simply divided into those colors? </li>
    <li>For those who suffered long-term air pollution, can the AQI/AQHI still warn them?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hedley Environmental Index</h4>
<p>Released by HKU, Hedley Environment Index calculates the economic losses caused by air pollution.</p>
